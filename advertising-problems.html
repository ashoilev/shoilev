    <h1>Advertising has a few problems</h1>
    <img src="advertising-hero.jpeg" width="869" height="363">
<p>I’ve been waiting far too long to get this off my chest. Here goes nothing.</p>
<h2>ASL</h2>
<p>I’ve almost graduated from New Bulgarian University as a Bachelor in Advertising. Whatever that means. I’m not a designer, I’m not a strategic planner, I’m not a media planner, I’m not a client service person. I just know stuff. About advertising.</p>
<p>If I go a few years back, I’ll find myself working as a salesman in a wine store. Deciding to study advertising wasn’t difficult — I didn’t have to read a ton of boring books, nor study as I had to studying International relations. In my mind, there was only one thing that makes you a great ad man — creativity. Easy, I thought.</p>
<p>Since that moment I am constantly on the internet, rejoicing on the amazing work agencies have done for their clients. I was mesmerized and excited that one day I’ll be able to be part of something that big, that inspiring.</p>
<p>I wanted to become a copywriter. Back then, in my mind, advertising consisted of copywriters, designers and some dull people nobody wants to talk to. So, having some experience with writing and journalism, I dedicated myself to become a copywriter.</p>
<p>It was my last year at university and I stumbled upon an opportunity for an internship in one of the best creative agencies in the country. I applied and they said “Yes’. It was exciting. I finally got my hands on some real work and it was magical — met some awesome new people, worked and generally learned a lot.</p>
<p>Anyway, the internship lasted exactly three months. Shortly after, I felt ready for a full-time job in an industry I loved.</p>
<h2>Here’s what’s wrong</h2>
<p>After almost a year of interviews here and there, I finally landed a job as a copywriter at a small to medium-sized ad agency. I was doing everything with maximum effort and genuine delight. But after a few months, something about the whole industry started to baffle me.</p>
<h3>The 90’s called, sent a fax and replied to all</h3>
<p>You might have been led to believe that the advertising business is on the cutting edge in terms of technology and communication, ensuring quick and positive workflow. Wrong. You want to send that document with that amazing ad you wrote? Use Skype.</p>
<p>The process from having an idea to actually executing it is difficult enough and includes a lot of internal and external feedback. It’s like no one in the industry has ever heard about cloud storage, Slack or anything that helps people achieve a better workflow. Working today with yesterday’s technology is annoying, to say the least.</p>
<h3>The lack of aesthetics</h3>
<p>There are a few exceptions here and there, but most of the stuff being made is not pretty. Not because the designers suck, but because of clients. Instead of being aesthetically pleasing and attention grabbing, designs grab people’s attention with their offensive ugliness. I’ve seen road signs, informing of ongoing construction, that grab my attention in much the same way as ads do.</p>
<h3>The problem of trust</h3>
<p>Clients generally don’t trust their agencies. This makes really difficult to persuade clients to implement different, truly creative ways to solve certain problems. Trust is lacking not only in our clients but in ourselves.</p>
<h3>We underrate people on a mass scale</h3>
<p>I’ve witnessed conversations between ad men, where people are treated like total idiots. How are brands supposed to have faith in people, when we treat them like buffoons?</p>
<h3>What data?</h3>
<p>This always baffled me. The most common notion is as if data or researches are cheating. But they aren’t. Both are a great way to find an insight or an interesting viewpoint to a certain problem. But this isn’t their greatest benefit — data and researches take out the subjectivity from an idea, solution or even from a whole strategy. Why? Because it’s backed up by actual data, not your gut or sense of prettiness or good work. Everything we do is for the people, not for the client, and certainly not for ourselves.</p>
<h3>Culture is our friend</h3>
<p>Habits, national peculiarities and language are great if you want to achieve an appealing and authentic communication and tone of voice. Shit is trending on the internet and social media as well. Instead, people are forced to listen to and read generic ads, no different to the ones 10 minutes ago. As a person I find that insulting, and I’m sure a lot of people find it the same way as well.</p>
<h3>Micromanagement</h3>
<p>Honestly, knowing micromanagement is such a big deal in an industry such as advertising is scary. It’s scary because teamwork is fundamental to great work. Micromanagement is a form of corporate dictatorship and we all know how that ends, right? Focus on a clear and concise brief, give feedback, don’t try to control the whole process. Don’t go down Micromanagement Road, It won’t end well.</p>
<h3>Hate is the official language of advertising</h3>
<p>Cynicism is the death of creativity, John Hegarty said that, not me. The lack of creativity or creative expression often leads to hate. Every now and then something really good comes out and ad people march into social media to express their negative opinions about it. All of a sudden, someone else’s work becomes more important than their own.</p>
<p><i>I admit, I’ve done it as well and it’s something I’m not proud of</i>.</p>

<h3>Oblivious clients won’t buy our BS easier</h3>
<p>Ok, I get it, clients stop us from making really good advertising. But should we, as professionals, agree with that? Of course not. Instead of hating, we should direct all our energy and effort into educating our clients on technology and good practices. Take time to explain why something works. Yes, that takes a little bit of extra effort, but, you know, we can make the world a better place, if not for our, for the next generation.</p>

<h3>Let’s stop working without context</h3>
<p>With the lack of planning comes the lack of context. With the lack of context comes bad, irrelevant, and let’s be honest here, rather stupid advertising. If I was in charge of a brand, I’ll do everything I can to launch a creative platform that helps me advertise easily and consistently throughout a year, at least. Sadly, that rarely happens.</p>

<h3>Social media is about the now</h3>
<p>As a copywriter I do social media and community management as well. I write posting plans for Facebook. That usually takes me 40 to 50 minutes per brand. When finished, the file is sent to the client, we do a quick Yes-Yes-No and we’re done. Shit will be posted regularly on Facebook. Screw emerging trends, forget about real time marketing, it’s all dust in the wind now. Yet again, this is a matter of trust between client and agency.</p>

<h3>“The execution always sucks”</h3>
<p>That’s a common notion. Especially when it comes to film. I really don’t understand why. When the script leaves the agency, it’s as if, from now on, everything is up to fate. If you don’t want to go trough the hassle of working with producers and directors, well, you shouldn’t be doing what your doing.</p>
<p>If something isn’t coming up the way you wanted it — speak to the people responsible, spend some time with them, talk. Educate them if you must.</p>
<p>Hey, third-party-production-people, I’m talking to you now: A small budget or project doesn’t give you the right to do bad job.</p>

<h3>Digital ain’t magic and it ain’t cheap</h3>
<p>It’s 2016 and “digital” is still being perceived as some sort of magic. Clients, even agencies, don’t have the technical knowledge in order to fully understand the channel, not to mention the execution of certain, more complicated, projects. Moreover, we are often facing a process where creative ideas are born and sold in isolation of production understanding.</p>
<p>Creating something online takes time. Creating something really good online, takes even more time.</p>
<p>If we, as an industry, want our work to go swimmingly and to receive relevant feedback, we’ll have to educate our clients.</p>
<p>I really hope this isn’t perceived as a rant, because it isn’t. I just want to ignite a convo, as Kanye West likes to put it. These problems might be of local significance, but something tells me they are not.
</p>
<p>I’ll be more than happy to hear another opinion.</p>
